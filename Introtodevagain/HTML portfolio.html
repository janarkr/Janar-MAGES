      <h1>What have I done so far?</h1>
      
      <p class="two">At 30 I hopelessly still feel young and unsure about what happens next. Some people may think of not being very certain about one's career future as a sign of not having direction. I have a Business Degree from Singapore Management University and some years working in Journalism. I write print articles in both English and Tamil. I also do page editing and sub-editing of the Tamil Murasu newspaper with the Indesign Software. I am also a field reporter, and I gather daily news as well as work on profile stories. While journalism has given many interesting experiences I consider it high time to venture into something else. The tech field is new to me but here's hoping for some success!!</p>

      <h1>What do I want to do in the future?</h1>

      <p class="one">I work with human languages for my profession. Technology is a huge disrupter in this era, I would like to be at least keeping some level of pace towards changing and adapting. No profession will be left untouched by deep technology and digital skills will be the new equivalent of literacy. I have no idea what journalism is going to evolve into, but if it takes a 'programming' turn, I would very much like to be ready for it. Resources like time and money are finite but if best managed, the satisfaction will be endless</p>
